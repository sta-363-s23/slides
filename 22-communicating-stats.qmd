# Honesty in Statistical Communication

# “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics”

## 

![](img/22/truth.png)

## Honesty in Statistical Communication

- Statistics is more of a science
- We take data and fit models to try draw inference or make predictions
- Many times, the truth we hope to describe or model is something that we can’t know

## Honesty in Statistical Communication

- As statisticians we acknowledge our **uncertainty** and **quantify** it
- Statisticians are in some sense more honest in their statements about the world than others who make absolute claims :)

# “Statistics [is] The only science that enables different experts using the same figures to draw different conclusions.” Evan Esar  {.small}

- Good statistical analyses include **judgments**

## Judgements

- What variables to include?
- What transformations to attempt?
- Is the data representative?
- Is the prediction model sound?
- What methods were used?
- Is the model overfit?

## Going forward {.small}

- To use statistics you must make judgments
- Know the motivating reason for the analysis because this will guide them in making these judgments
- The guiding principle in making statistics judgments is a search for truth about the world
- Resist jumping to conclusions, extrapolating, and proposing explanations for associations that assume causation
