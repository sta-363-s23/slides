## Agenda

- Demo: Penguin Study
- R and RStudio
- Quarto


# A Penguin Study {.center}


## Recap: What did we just do?

- Create a project in **RStudio**
- Open a .qmd file in **RStudio**
- Render the analysis 
- Edit the analysis 
- Re-render the analysis

## Login to RStudio Pro {.smaller}

- **Note:** if you are off campus, you will need to use a [VPN to connect](https://is.wfu.edu/services/vpn/)
- Go to [rstudio.deac.wfu.edu](rstudio.deac.wfu.edu)

## RStudio Pro Setup

**Step 1: Create a New Project**

Click File > New Project

![](img/01/new-project.png)

## RStudio Pro Setup

**Step 2: Click "Version Control"**

Click the third option.

![](img/01/version-control.png)

## RStudio Pro Setup

**Step 3: Click Git**

Click the first option

![](img/01/git.png)

## RStudio Pro Setup

**Step 4: Copy my starter files**

Paste this link in the top box (`Repository url`):

`https://github.com/sta-112-f22/appex-01-welcome-penguins.git`

![](img/01/paste-link.png)

## {{< fa laptop >}} `Penguin fun!` {.smaller}

- Once you log on to RStudio Pro, create a new project from version control (Git)
- Paste `https://github.com/sta-363-s23/appex-01-welcome-penguins.git` in the Repository url box
- Find the file pane (on the bottom right). Click the `welcome-penguins.qmd` file
- Click the "Render" button
- Go back to the file and change your name on top (in the `yaml` -- we'll talk about what this means later) and render again.
- Then, scroll to the `plot` chunk, below **Palmer Penguins**. Instead of looking at the relationship between flipper length and bill length, plot the relationship between flipper length and bill **depth**. _Hint, look at the full dataset at the bottom of the document for variable names, update the captions to match your new plot_. 
- Render again & voila!

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| cache: false
countdown(minutes = 8, font_size = "1.5em")
```

## What is R?

::: {.incremental}

- scripting language
- statistical software
- like a car's "engine"

:::

## What is RStudio?

::: {.incremental}

- IDE (integrated development environment)
- like a car's "dashboard"
:::

# Let's take a tour -- R / RStudio

## What did we learn?

- Using the console
- Using R as a calculator
- Environment
- Loading and viewing a data frame
- Creating a Project



## R essentials {.smaller}

A short list (for now):

- Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

. . .

- Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
dataframe$var_name
```

. . .

- Packages are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```



## tidyverse

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](img/02/tidyverse.png)

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**R packages for data science**

::: {.small}
The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

# Quarto

## Quarto

::: {.incremental}
- Fully reproducible reports -- each time you render the document the analysis is run from the beginning
- Simple markdown syntax for text
- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks
:::

# Let's take a tour - Quarto

## What did we learn?

- Creating a project
- Creating a `.qmd` file
- Rendering documents
- Visual Editor
- The YAML
- Markdown and (some) R syntax

## Rendering {.smaller}

Use the <kbd>![](img/02/rstudio-render-button.png){width="25" height="20"}</kbd> **Render** button in the RStudio IDE to render the file and preview the output with a single click or keyboard shortcut (⇧⌘K). 

![](img/02/rstudio-render.png){.border fig-align="center"}

. . .

If you prefer to automatically render whenever you save, you can check the Render on Save option on the editor toolbar.

## YAML header

The YAML header starts and ends with three dashes

``` yaml
---
title: "This is a title"
format: html
editor: visual
---
```
::: {.footer}

## Code chunks

R code chunks identified with `{r}` with (optional) chunk options, in YAML style, identified by `#|` at the beginning of the line.

```` markdown
```{{r}}
#| label: load-packages
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```
````

. . . 

::: {.question}
Would this code chunk be "included" in the final report?
:::

::: {.footer}
[Getting Started with Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)
:::

## Markdown text

::: {.incremental}
* Quarto uses markdown for formatting text, including section headers, hyperlinks, an embedded image, and an inline code chunk.
* If you use the "visual" editor, you don't need to learn much of this

## {{< fa laptop >}} `Your turn`

- Log into RStudio Pro 
- Open the project you created in the last class
- Explore the visual editor -- try adding some **bold** text to the document

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| cache: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 4, font_size = "3em")
```


## Workspaces {.smaller}

Remember this, and expect it to bite you a few times as you're learning to work 
with Quarto: The workspace of your Quarto document is separate from the Console!

- Run the following in the console
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
x <- 2
x * 3
```

. . .

::: {.question}
All looks good, eh?
:::

. . .

- Then, add the following chunk in your Quarto document
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
x * 3
```

. . .

::: {.question}
What happens? Why the error?
:::




## How will we use Quarto?

- Every assignment / report / project / etc. is a Quarto document
- You'll often have a template Quarto document to start with
- The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester
- You will turn in the .html file on Canvas


## Lab 01

- Lab instructions are posted on the course website under `assignment`
  + Let's go find today's!
